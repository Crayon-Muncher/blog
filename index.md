The SIG-Game Development team develops and maintains a framework to
host MegaMinarAI and other programming competitions.

As our competition attendance has grown to record levels, the SIG-Game
Developers have begun a redesign of the competition framework. Each
component of the framework is open source and available on GitHub.
