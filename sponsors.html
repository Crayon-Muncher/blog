  <p class="lead">
    Sentry is an event logging platform
    primarily focused on capturing and aggregating exceptions.
  </p>

 <p>
    It was originally conceived at <a href="http://disqus.com/">DISQUS</a>
    in early 2010 to solve exception logging within a Django application.
    Since then it has grown to support many popular languages and platforms,
    including Python, PHP, Java, Ruby, Node.js, and even JavaScript.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">Open Source</p>

  <p>
    The hosted version of Sentry, that is, getsentry.com, is run by using the open
    source version of Sentry with several additional proprietary plugins. That said,
    nearly every change that is needed for the hosted version to work is actually
    made upstream first, usually in the form of an extensible interface.
  </p>
