      <h1>Hello, SIG-Game</h1>
      <p>
        SIG-Game is a special interest group for Missouri S&amp;T
        students that develops and hosts artificial intelligence
        programming competitions at our campus in Rolla, Missouri.

    <h2>A Brief History of SIG-Game</h2>
    <p>
      The Missouri S&amp;T Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
      Special Interest Group for AI Competition Game Development
      (SIG-Game) started in Fall 2007 as a gung-ho group of developers
      from Missouri S&amp;T loosely associated with ACM. Their goal was to
      create a competition designed to test a competitor’s ability to
      design an effective artificially intelligent player for a novel
      game. Thus MegaMinerAI was born.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the development team grew, and with the success of each
      semester’s competition, the group formalized under the title
      SIG-Game. With the increased size, comes increased
      flexibility. While the initial development (Dev) team needed people
      with networking ability, current members work on: asynchronous
      communication, compression, databases, distributed computing,
      evolutionary algorithms, game theory, graphic design, interpreters,
      language interoperability, meta programming, parallel computing,
      procedural generation, testing, visualization, and more.

    <h2>What We Do</h2> 
    <p>
      In addition to developing novel games for MegaMinerAI, the
      SIG-Game Development team develops and maintains a framework to
      host MegaMinerAI and other programming competitions. Though game
      details are kept secret until competition day, our framework is
      open source and available on GitHub. Check us out
      at <a href="http://siggame.github.com">siggame.github.com</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      As our competition attendance has grown to record levels, the SIG-Game
      Developers have begun a redesign of the competition framework. Each
      component of the framework is open source and available on GitHub.
