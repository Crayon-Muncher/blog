  <h1>Hello, SIG-Game</h1>
  <p>
    SIG-Game is a special interest group for Missouri S&amp;T
    students that develops and hosts artificial intelligence
    programming competitions on S&amp;T's campus in Rolla,
    Missouri.

<h2 id="Brief-History">A Brief History of SIG-Game</h2>
<p>
  The Missouri S&amp;T Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
  Special Interest Group for AI Competition Game Development
  (SIG-Game) started in Fall 2007 as a gung-ho group of developers
  from Missouri S&amp;T loosely associated with the S&amp;T
  student chapter of ACM. Their goal was to create a programming
  competition designed to test a competitor’s ability to design
  and implement an effective, artificially intelligent player for a
  novel game. Thus MegaMinerAI was born.
</p>

<p>
  As the development team grew, and with the success of each
  semester’s competition, the group formalized under the title
  SIG-Game. With the increased size, comes increased
  flexibility. While the initial development (Dev) team needed people
  with networking ability, current members work on: asynchronous
  communication, compression, databases, distributed computing,
  evolutionary algorithms, game theory, graphic design, interpreters,
  language interoperability, meta programming, parallel computing,
  procedural generation, testing, visualization, and more.

<p>
  In addition to developing novel games for MegaMinerAI, the
  SIG-Game Development team develops and maintains a framework to
  host MegaMinerAI and other programming competitions. Though game
  details are kept secret until competition day, our framework is
  open source and available
  on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siggame">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
  As our competition attendance has grown to record levels, the SIG-Game
  Developers have begun a redesign of the competition framework. Each
  component of the framework is open source and available on GitHub.
