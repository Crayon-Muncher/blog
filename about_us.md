# About Us

The Missouri S&amp;T Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special
Interest Group for AI Competition Game Development (SIG-Game) started
in Fall 2007 as a gung-ho group of developers from Missouri S&amp;T
loosely associated with ACM. Their goal was to create a competition
designed to test a competitor's ability to design an effective
artificially intelligent player for a novel game. Thus MegaMinerAI was
born.

As the development team grew, and with the success of each semester's
competition, the group formalized under the title SIG-Game. With the
increased size, comes increased flexibility. While the initial
development (Dev) team needed people with networking ability, current
members work on: asynchronous communication, compression, databases,
distributed computing, evolutionary algorithms, game theory, graphic
design, interpreters, language interoperability, meta programming,
parallel computing, procedural generation, testing, visualization, and
more.
