Registration for MegaMinerAI 10: Galapagos is now open! Log in or
create a new account, then click on the competitions tab at the top of
the page to navigate to the registration page. We would also like to
note that members of ACM that have paid their dues will receive a $5
from their teams dues, so if you have 3 ACM members you only have to
pay $3 each! Competition will be from noon on November 10th to noon on
November 11th so be to remember the date! Let's see if we can break
100 competitors with this semester's competition!
